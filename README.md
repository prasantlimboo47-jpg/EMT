## Electromagnetic Laws Library (C++)

This project is a simple C++ library created to demonstrate the implementation of fundamental Electromagnetic (EM) laws using proper programming structure. It is designed mainly for academic learning, assignments, and basic understanding of how physical laws can be represented computationally.

## Overview

The library contains implementations of important electromagnetic laws such as Coulomb’s law, Ampere’s law, Biot–Savart law, Gauss’s law, and simplified forms of Maxwell’s equations in one, two, and three dimensions. The project follows a clean structure with separate header files, source files, and example programs.

## Implemented Electromagnetic Laws

The following laws are included in this library:

Coulomb’s Law for electric force between charges

Ampere’s Law for magnetic field due to current

Biot–Savart Law for magnetic field calculation

Gauss’s Law for electric flux

Maxwell’s Equation in one dimension (1D)

Maxwell’s Equation in two dimensions (2D)

Maxwell’s Equation in three dimensions (3D)


## Project Structure Description

The project is organized into three main folders:

include: Contains all header files declaring functions and constants

src: Contains source files implementing the declared functions

examples: Contains example programs demonstrating how to use the library

## Purpose of the Project

This project is created for educational purposes. It helps students:

Understand electromagnetic laws through programming

Learn how to organize a C++ library

Practice manual compilation using a compiler

Build a basic scientific programming portfolio for GitHub

## Tools Used

C++ programming language

Visual Studio Code

GNU g++ compiler

GitHub (for version control and project hosting)
